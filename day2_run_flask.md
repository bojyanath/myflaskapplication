**            DAY 2 - RUN FLASK
* To run our flask application first make sure your working directory should be the directory which contains pythyon file.(ie.,-c:/users/bojya/workspace/two-tier-flask-app)
* Next Run python file using below syntax.
```mysql
SYNTAX : python app.py
```
NOTE : if any error occurs at the step make sure  all required dependencies are installed because as we mentioned in our code that import flask and flask_mysql_db these are called dependencies
```mysql
syntax : pip install flask, 
    pip install flask_mysql_db.
```
* If there is no error at this step it says :
  * Serving Flask app 'app'
  * Debug mode: on
  * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
  * Running on http://192.168.1.209:5000
* it means flask is done and its running in the above server.
* make sure whether your flask application is running by entering any one of the above IP_ADDRESS in web browser .
* so that in we browser you can see flask application running successfully.
